        <p>
          This assignment was a continuation of the prior assignment we had been working on. From the prior assignment,
          we had the front cover of this assignment. Now we were to build a enclosure to accompany the top. So rather
          than just the independent lid that we have, we are building something to hold all of our wires, the pico, and
          the breadboard.<br>
          Most of the hardware was now done. So in terms of wiring, I had to better organize wires to make them fit in
          the planned enclosure so that they definitely did not interfere with each other. Previously, the wires would
          have been accessible to me but if they are now being contained in a body, I have to confirm the components are
          comfortably locked in place.

        <p>
          The LED assignment is comprised of multiple phases as it stretches across multiple arcs.
          <br>
          -- <b>Phase 1</b> is our intro to creating a circuit of LEDs. We used cardboard to hold our LEDs in
          place while we had all the wiring and connections behind the cardboard
          <br>
          -- The main pull from <b>phase 2</b> was using a breadboard to limit the amount of soldering. With
          the use of the breadboard, as well as having to solder less, it also allows the wiring to look cleaner
          and more organized.
          <br>
          -- <b>Phase 3</b> introduced a switch system to our circuit. previously we had been just touching the ends
          of our wire to our 9V battery. Now we had a battery clip that we could hook up to
          <br>
          -- <b>Phase 4</b> was supposed to be our final presentation of the prior 3 phases. I do not think I
          followed the order of phases or operations correctly as I do not think I executed the desired result. What I
          presented did not use a breadboard or a clothes peg switch. I had been preoccupied testing the breadboard and
          the copper switch concept with loose LED bulbs, making sure I was understanding how I'd be
          <br><br>
          -- I shaped my 6 LEDs into a triangle as it was an easy, manageable shape. I am weirdly quite familiar
          with triangles as me and a partner wrote a javascript function to make coding easier than the default js
          function.
          <br><br>
          -- <b>Phase 5</b> is art106 MakerFaire Led Synth, a collaborative project between the whole art106 class that
          is to be presented at Maker Faire. The class was broken into pairs and with our partner we were to design an
          image out of multiple LEDs. The board has to have 4 switchable circuits in order to trigger the whole image.
          My partner and I both enjoyed videogames. So we wanted to make an pixel art Pac-Man. <br>
          Our design shows our whole image to be made out of 9 trios of LEDs and 2 quads and those 11 are split between
          4
          different switches in such a way that if only one switch is pressed(many two), your would not be able to tell
          what the design is. It definitely requires all 4 switches to appreciate.
