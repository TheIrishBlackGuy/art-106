         <p>
		This exercise introduced the parent/child functions and how to use them to build, in this case, characters. 
    The child functions are comparable to the ingredients as the parent function is the final meal. 
    Following this analogy, once the meal is prepared and made, you can bring it to wherever you wish.    
    <br><br>
    This exercise showcases the new translate, scale, rotate, bounce, and wrapper tools. 
    I had success understanding how they work but 
    I did have difficulty when it came to use of translate and setting an origin to link child functions to. 
    making use of the child function i was able to utilize the same face put be able to customize the character with interchangeable hats, glasses and hair styles.
    I wanted to try to make the character customizable in the code and I think I succeeded while everything worked alongside that success.

         <h5><b>Exercise 4</b></h5>
		<p>
        With this exercise, the class system was introduced and converting a function of ours into a class that can be called upon. 
        Building off of this, we were able to carry other's classes to ours and have them co-exist independent of each others.
        <br><br>
        I had an initial rough start with the function-to-class action. 
        I had essentially just made a function into a more condensed function and misunderstood the class portion. 
        But after I had a better grasp, it became a bit more fluid. 
        Once established, I was able to interact and mess with my variables easier. 
        Even further, I understood how to easily move and manipulate others classes into my code.

         <h5><b>Project 2: The Algorithms</b>
        </h5> 
          
		<p>
         With this project, we were interacting with manipulation of algorithms.
         I took a liking towards the Lindenmayer system(L-system).
         It had a very structured feel to it which clicked to me.
         <br><br>   

         Turns out the structured feel of this algorithm was the hardest part of this project.
         Looking at the code, the ratio of numbers to words was immense. 
         It took me a long time to find pieces I could alter to produce a slightly different visual. 
         Even then, it took so much longer to manipulate it to make it more of mine own.
         <br><br>
        
         Once I understood some pieces of this algorithm better, 
         I started messing with color and shape based on position and randomization. 
         I learned some other pieces of how to change stuff but nothing grand resulted from it. 
         On my last few days working with it, i found more but too late to be fully integrated into my code.  
         <br><br>

         Recording and downloading the images/frames had some issues in the beginning just due to a self misunderstanding of some numbers. 
         but once that was figured out, it was smooth sailing right up until trying to export the final video. 
         I do not why this was causing so much grief. Eventually it got figured out though I still don't know where the issue lay.
