        <h5><b>Exercise 6</b>
       </h5> 
         
   <p>
    This exercise was prompted alongside and was meant to be used as an introduction to Project 4. 
    This was not much of the case for me though. I had a lack of an idea towards my final project 
    and did not know where to begin looking at Exercise 6 to see which parts of it I needed to start taking apart. 
    After ripping most of it apart, Project 4 is entirely derived from the stripped bones of Exercise 6.
    <br><br>   

     I only replaced a few sprites and added my choice of music. 
     Besides that, the most work I put towards this exercise was reading the code and seeing how it can be manipulated. 
     It took some time to break it down and see what code affected what or what would happen when I poked a certain thing. 
     After that process behind the code, I just jumped straight into Project 4.

         <h5><b>Project 4: The Pokedex </b>
        </h5> 
          
		<p>
      The thought process going into this project start further back in the semester when I was joking with my friends about the thought of making a custom pokedex. 
        When Project 4 came around, I wanted to follow through on that idea.      

      <br><br>   

      When thinking about specifics and requirement, I was initially thinking about having the pokedex act just as it does in the games and shows. 
        But the level of technicality was something beyond my current coding knowledge as of right now. 
        Originally, I wanted to make it so that a user could input information and it would save locally. 
        I could then have a roster of people inside the pokedex associated with a pokemon icon of their selection. 
        I don't yet know how user text input works so instead, I've hard-coded my friends and their pokemon choice into the pokedex and made it navigatable. 
          
      <br><br>
        
        So for this project, I asked my friends for their favorite, generation one pokemon and that gave me all the information necessary to continue the plan of attack. 
        I designed a pokedex to frame all of the work. 
        Each and every scene has two or more interactive/clickable buttons. 
        Each pokemon has an associated sound that is playable. 
        There is also background music while using the program and navigating between programs.

        <br><br>
        
        Difficult parts of this project were my initial introduction to scenes. 
        Something about it wasn't clicking for me till a friend broke it down a lot blunter for me. 
        I then realized how easy of a concept it was and proceeded to go all in on it. Once I have a solid grasp, I'm able to lock in.
        Due to this mentality, I often go overboard or over necessary requirements for things. 
        There are now several other ideas that are spurring from this one concept of scenes.        
        <br><br>
        
        An easier part of the pokedex was its repeatable nature. 
        All pages follow the same layout and it seems just a case of choosing changing a value or line of code.
        Due to this, I think that once I figure out an input method, 
        it would be relatively easy to input information and have the code just place the values in the correct space to produce the desired outcome.         
        <br><br><br>

          The sounds used in this project were pulled from various sources:<br> 
            <br>Background music from 'The Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow' Soundtrack.
            <br>Pokemon cries from <a href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/" >pokemonshowdown</a>'s audio files.
            <br>Select button pulled from pokemon games.
