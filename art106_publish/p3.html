         <h5> <b>Exercise 5</b></h5> 
         
         <p>
            We've now entered the world of grid arrays.
            We can pull a value from a set of values we estblished within are array.
            Different from previous arrays, we can now pull a value out of a collection of values
            after we've chosen which collective of  collectives of value we want to collect from
            (This can get many more layers deep).
            <br><br>
            Using this method, we went about drawing 'pixel art', 
            choosing which number value we wanted to choose among a selection of numbers.
            For example, choosing the number 5 when asked to choose a number 0-9. 
            5 is the value of the collective 0-9.
            If ask to make a 3 digit number selecting values 0-9, 
            your collectives would look like : <br><br>
            [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],<br>
            [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],<br>    
            [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] <br>
            = your 3 valued number
          <br><br>
            Then we just had to assign which value we wanted to equal which color, shape, or image.
            and that produced the backbone for all of our grid array image maps.

         <h5><b>Project 3: The Clock</b></h5> 
          
		<p>

      For this project, we made custom clocks based on our daily routine or a general theme. I based my theme around the game of Minecraft. 
      Most components of the clock are based on map code, tracking and positioning assets or coded instructions to follow the user's clock in their system. 
      This clock can displays indication of time of day/night, hours, minutes, and seconds. All other lines of code are mostly visuals rather than the 'gears' of the clock.

        <br><br>   

      When coding the clock, a difficult part was managing all the moving components and making sure they either cooperated with each other or if they operated independently.
      Of the difficult things to code was the little character and his movement. I found that slowly verbalizing the action you want to occur often helps. So with him there are several nested 
      if statements and different mappings just to allow him to move and face as he does. That specific piece of code is wierdly my favorite because of what it produced and how clean it looks.
        <br><br>
        
      Initially, I had tried and partially succeeded in making use of the shape codes in js code. That was tedious. 
      Later, I found it easier and less time restrictive to make assets in a different program and move then into my code. 
      This left room for more customization, less use in numbers, and more artistic skill.
