        <p>
          We were to use all of our new components to make an interactive board that would be the precursor to the next
          project. Initially working on with the pico was difficult with trying to understand the differences and
          purposes of the hardware versus software pins. Once I understood that a bit better, It became easier to
          manipulate the pins and wires and that seemed to make things a bit easier for me to work in comparison to the
          original layout that was presented in class.<br><br>
          This assignment would be my first interaction with a laser cutter. Being unfamiliar with illustrator and
          having made the first reference image in MSpaint, I asked classmates for help. So that kind of resulted in
          them fixing my Illustrator file and cutting out the board itself.

        <p>
          The LED assignment is comprised of multiple phases as it stretches across multiple arcs.
          <br>
          -- <b>Phase 1</b> is our intro to creating a circuit of LEDs. We used cardboard to hold our LEDs in
          place while we had all the wiring and connections behind the cardboard
          <br>
          -- The main pull from <b>phase 2</b> was using a breadboard to limit the amount of soldering. With
          the use of the breadboard, as well as having to solder less, it also allows the wiring to look cleaner
          and more organized.
          <br>
          -- <b>Phase 3</b> introduced a switch system to our circuit. previously we had been just touching the ends
          of our wire to our 9V battery. Now we had a battery clip that we could hook up to
          <br>
          -- <b>Phase 4</b> was supposed to be our final presentation of the prior 3 phases. I do not think I
          followed the order of phases or operations correctly as I do not think I executed the desired result. What I
          presented did not use a breadboard or a clothes peg switch. I had been preoccupied testing the breadboard and
          the copper switch concept with loose LED bulbs, making sure I was understanding how I'd be
          <br><br>
          -- I shaped my 6 LEDs into a triangle as it was an easy, manageable shape. I am weirdly quite familiar
          with triangles as me and a partner wrote a javascript function to make coding easier than the default js
          function.
          <br><br>
          -- <b>Phase 5</b> is art106 MakerFaire Led Synth, a collaborative project between the whole art106 class that
          is to be presented at Maker Faire. The class was broken into pairs and with our partner we were to design an
          image out of multiple LEDs. The board has to have 4 switchable circuits in order to trigger the whole image.
          My partner and I both enjoyed videogames. So we wanted to make an pixel art Pac-Man. <br>
          Our design shows our whole image to be made out of 9 trios of LEDs and 2 quads and those 11 are split between
          4
          different switches in such a way that if only one switch is pressed(many two), your would not be able to tell
          what the design is. It definitely requires all 4 switches to appreciate.
